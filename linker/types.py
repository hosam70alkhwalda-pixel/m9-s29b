    ----------
    span : str
        The surface form of the NER span (the text the linker saw).
    predicted_uri : Optional[str]
        The URI the linker resolved the span to, or ``None`` for NIL.
    reason : str
        One of:
        ``"resolved-unique"`` — a single candidate matched (no disambiguation needed)
        ``"resolved-by-type"`` — disambiguation picked a candidate via type compatibility
        ``"resolved-by-context"`` — disambiguation picked a candidate via the secondary signal
        ``"nil-no-candidates"`` — no candidate matched the surface form
        ``"nil-ambiguous"`` — multiple candidates survived all disambiguation signals
        ``"nil-no-type-mapping"`` — the NER label had no mapping in NER_LABEL_TO_KG_TYPE
    start : int
        Character offset of the span start in the source text.
    end : int
        Character offset of the span end (exclusive).
